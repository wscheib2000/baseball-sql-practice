      , SUM(G) AS G
      , SUM(GS) AS GS
      , ROUND(CAST(SUM(GS) AS REAL) / SUM(G), 3) AS GS_prop
      , SUM(IPouts) AS outs_recorded
      , SUM(HR) AS HR
      , SUM(BB + HBP) AS BB
      , SUM(SO) AS K
    FROM PITCHING p
    GROUP BY p.playerID, p.yearID
  ) AS tmp
WHERE tmp.GS_prop > 0.75 AND tmp.year >= 1990 AND tmp.outs_recorded >= 200;
